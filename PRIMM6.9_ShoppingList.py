#Purpose: To create a program to add items to a shopping list.

shoppingList = ["milk","bread"]
shoppingList.append("potatoes")

print(shoppingList)

"""
1. Ask the user to input the next item on the list.
2. Change the print statement to be more user friendly
with the following text "Here is you shopping list: "
3. Create a loop to ask the user to input three more items on the list.
4. Have the computer display a message that tells the user what
item was just added to the list.
5. Change the program so the input loop continues until the user enters 0.
6. Change the program so that it checks if an item is already on the list
and sends the user an appropriate message if it is.
The program should take into account that the user might enter in upper or lower case.
